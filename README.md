# blockchain-ledger

The purpose of this project is to build a locally hosted block chain which is able to accept new blocks and validate them as well. <br>
The steps to complete the ledger were: <br>
-Create a Record Data Class <br>
-Modify the Existing Block Data Class to Store Record Data <br>
-Add Relevant User Inputs to the Streamlit Interface <br>
-Test the PyChain Ledger by Storing Records <br>

## Usage

To use this program, download github repository clone and open the "pychain.py" file, run the file and type "streamlit run pychain.py" into the command line.  This will open up the host on your browser.  From there you can add info to new block to add to a new block chain.  Here it is in action:
